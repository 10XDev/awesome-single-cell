# awesome-single-cell
List of software packages for single-cell data analysis, including RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, etc.

## Software packages

### RNA-seq
- [Monocle](http://cole-trapnell-lab.github.io/monocle-release/) - [R] - Differential expression and time-series analysis for single-cell RNA-Seq.
- [MAST](https://github.com/RGLab/MAST) - [R] - Model-based Analysis of Single-cell Transcriptomics
(MAST) fits a two-part, generalized linear models that are specially adapted for bimodal and/or zero-inflated single cell gene expression data.
- [SCONE](https://github.com/YosefLab/scone) - [R] - SCONE (Single-Cell Overview of Normalized Expression), a package for single-cell RNA-seq data quality control (QC) and normalization. This data-driven framework uses summaries of expression data to assess the efficacy of normalization workflows.
- [clusterExperiment](https://github.com/epurdom/clusterExperiment) - [R] - Functions for running and comparing many different clusterings of single-cell sequencing data. Meant to work with SCONE and slingshot
- [slingshot](https://github.com/kstreet13/slingshot) - [R] - Functions for identifying and characterizing continuous developmental trajectories in single-cell sequencing data.

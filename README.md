# awesome-single-cell

List of software packages for single-cell data analysis, including RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, etc. [Contributions welcome](https://github.com/seandavi/awesome-single-cell/blob/master/CONTRIBUTE.md)...

## Software packages

- [clusterExperiment](https://github.com/epurdom/clusterExperiment) - [R] - Functions for running and comparing many different clusterings of single-cell sequencing data. Meant to work with SCONE and slingshot
- [MAST](https://github.com/RGLab/MAST) - [R] - Model-based Analysis of Single-cell Transcriptomics
(MAST) fits a two-part, generalized linear models that are specially adapted for bimodal and/or zero-inflated single cell gene expression data.
- [Monocle](http://cole-trapnell-lab.github.io/monocle-release/) - [R] - Differential expression and time-series analysis for single-cell RNA-Seq.
- [SCONE](https://github.com/YosefLab/scone) - [R] - SCONE (Single-Cell Overview of Normalized Expression), a package for single-cell RNA-seq data quality control (QC) and normalization. This data-driven framework uses summaries of expression data to assess the efficacy of normalization workflows.
- [sincell](http://bioconductor.org/packages/sincell) - [R] - Existing computational approaches for the assessment of cell-state hierarchies from single-cell data might be formalized under a general workflow composed of i) a metric to assess cell-to-cell similarities (combined or not with a dimensionality reduction step), and ii) a graph-building algorithm (optionally making use of a cells-clustering step). Sincell R package implements a methodological toolbox allowing flexible workflows under such framework.
- [slingshot](https://github.com/kstreet13/slingshot) - [R] - Functions for identifying and characterizing continuous developmental trajectories in single-cell sequencing data.

## Tutorials and workflows
 
- [Aaron Lun's Single Cell workflow on Bioconductor](http://bioconductor.org/help/workflows/simpleSingleCell/) - [R] - This article describes a computational workflow for basic analysis of scRNA-seq data using software packages from the open-source Bioconductor project.
- [Bioconductor2016 Single-cell-RNA-sequencing workshop by Sandrine Dudoit lab](https://github.com/drisso/bioc2016singlecell) - [R] - SCONE, clusterExperiment, and slingshot tutorial.
- [BiomedCentral Single Cell Omics collectin](http://www.biomedcentral.com/collections/singlecellomics) - collection of papers describing techniques for single-cell analysis and protocols.

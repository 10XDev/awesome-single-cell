# awesome-single-cell

List of software packages for single-cell data analysis, including RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, etc. [Contributions welcome](https://github.com/seandavi/awesome-single-cell/blob/master/CONTRIBUTE.md)...

## Software packages

- [clusterExperiment](https://github.com/epurdom/clusterExperiment) - [R] - Functions for running and comparing many different clusterings of single-cell sequencing data. Meant to work with SCONE and slingshot
- [MAST](https://github.com/RGLab/MAST) - [R] - Model-based Analysis of Single-cell Transcriptomics
(MAST) fits a two-part, generalized linear models that are specially adapted for bimodal and/or zero-inflated single cell gene expression data.
- [Monocle](http://cole-trapnell-lab.github.io/monocle-release/) - [R] - Differential expression and time-series analysis for single-cell RNA-Seq.
- [OEFinder](https://github.com/lengning/OEFinder) - [R] - Identify ordering effect genes in single cell RNA-seq data. OEFinder shiny impelemention depends on packages shiny, shinyFiles, gdata, and EBSeq. 
- [SCell](https://github.com/diazlab/SCell) - [matlab] - SCell is an integrated software tool for quality filtering, normalization, feature selection, iterative dimensionality reduction, clustering and the estimation of gene-expression gradients from large ensembles of single-cell RNA-seq datasets. SCell is open source, and implemented with an intuitive graphical interface.
- [scLVM](https://github.com/PMBio/scLVM) - [R] - scLVM is a modelling framework for single-cell RNA-seq data that can be used to dissect the observed heterogeneity into different sources, thereby allowing for the correction of confounding sources of variation.  scLVM was primarily designed to account for cell-cycle induced variations in single-cell RNA-seq data where cell cycle is the primary soure of variability. 
- [SCONE](https://github.com/YosefLab/scone) - [R] - SCONE (Single-Cell Overview of Normalized Expression), a package for single-cell RNA-seq data quality control (QC) and normalization. This data-driven framework uses summaries of expression data to assess the efficacy of normalization workflows.
- [SCOUP](https://github.com/hmatsu1226/SCOUP) - [C++] - Uses probabilistic model based on the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process to analyze single-cell expression data during differentiation. 
- [sincell](http://bioconductor.org/packages/sincell) - [R] - Existing computational approaches for the assessment of cell-state hierarchies from single-cell data might be formalized under a general workflow composed of i) a metric to assess cell-to-cell similarities (combined or not with a dimensionality reduction step), and ii) a graph-building algorithm (optionally making use of a cells-clustering step). Sincell R package implements a methodological toolbox allowing flexible workflows under such framework.
- [SinQC](http://www.morgridge.net/SinQC.html) - [R] - A Method and Tool to Control Single-cell RNA-seq Data Quality.
- [SLICER](https://github.com/jw156605/SLICER) - [R] - Selective Locally linear Inference of Cellular Expression Relationships (SLICER) algorithm for inferring cell trajectories.
- [slingshot](https://github.com/kstreet13/slingshot) - [R] - Functions for identifying and characterizing continuous developmental trajectories in single-cell sequencing data.
- [SPADE](http://www.nature.com/nprot/journal/v11/n7/full/nprot.2016.066.html) - [R] - Visualization and cellular hierarchy inference of single-cell data using SPADE.
- [TSCAN](https://github.com/zji90/TSCAN) - [R] - Pseudo-time reconstruction and evaluation in single-cell RNA-seq analysis.
